## 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept, Instrumentation & Practical skill, Data analysis

By this experiment we want users to understand the relation between hardness and quality of water. By doing this experiment they would enhance their practical skills and they would themselves analyze the suitability of water for potable and food purposes on the basis of estimated value of hardness of sample water. 

## 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

<b> Description </b><br>
Here we have identified four learning objectives. As the experiment gives the knowledge about the relation of hardness with quality of water required for potable and food purpose, therefore it includes remembering of the pre-learnt concepts and then understanding the new concepts. Further during the experiment, user will be able to perform the titration process and based on the observed data users will be able to analyze and achieve the outcome. 
<br/>

<b> Method</b>
<br/>To achieve attainment of all the objectives, the experiment is designed to analyze the quality of water required for potable and food purpose, so that students may learn through performing.

## 3. Instructional Strategy  

<b>Name of Instructional Strategy: </b> <u> Guided inquiry</u>
<br/>

<b>Assessment Method:</b> <u>Formative assessment</u>
<br/>

<b>Description:</b> <u>Step by step instructions are provided at each level in the simulator to make it more user-friendly and make the process easier to gets results from the observed data. Further, on analyzing the result, user can interpret the quality of water on the basis of hardness. </u>

## 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--
1.| User will take out 25 ml water sample using pipette and add to conical flask  | Simulator will display addition of water sample into the conical flask using pipette   | To prepare sample for further analysis
2.| User will measure 1 ml ammonia buffer solution and add to sample conical flask | Simulator will display addition of 1 ml ammonia buffer solution into the conical flask | To adjust pH of solution around 10
3.| User will use pH meter to confirm pH of solution by putting the pH meter probe in the solution  | Simulator will display pH of solution on pH meter screen | To confirm adjusted pH of solution 
4.| User will add 2-3 drops of EBT indicator in the sample conical flask | Simulator will display addition of 2-3 drops of EBT indicator in the sample conical flask | To prepare sample for titration
5.| User will fill the burette with 0.01M standard EDTA solution | Simulator will display addition of 0.01M standard EDTA solution in burette | To titrate the sample
